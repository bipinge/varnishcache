How Varnish met CHERI 7/N
=========================

Not much news
-------------

I have been occupied with other activities, so there isn't much
news about CHERI to report, except that I have still not been
able to find any actual bugs in Varnish with it.

Having spent almost two decades with the quality knob stuck at "11"
that is how it should be, and there's no denying that I am a little
bit proud of that.

But it also means I do not have a bug killed, classified and on
display for the rest of the world to see just how amazing CHERI is,
and why it should become standard in all computers:  Embedded,
handheld, servers, development, test and production.

Revisiting obscure corners of Varnish has caused me to commit
a few of "spit&polish" changes, including an API which should
have returned ``const`` but did not.

But I have not given up yet, and I will find a good example of what
CHERI can do, sooner or later, but it may not be in the Varnish
source code.
